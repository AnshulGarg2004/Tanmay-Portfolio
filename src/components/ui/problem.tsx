        Lucknow, like many rapidly growing cities, struggles with significant traffic congestion that impacts daily life for its residents. One of the primary causes of this congestion is illegal encroachments on public roads and sidewalks. Vendors, shops, and unauthorized structures often occupy parts of the streets and pavements, narrowing the available space for vehicles and pedestrians. This reduces the road capacity and creates bottlenecks, especially during peak hours.

        The problem is further compounded by the lack of organized parking facilities, which forces vehicles to park haphazardly on the roads, further restricting smooth traffic movement. Key areas such as Naka, Hazratganj, and Chinhat are well-known for their severe traffic jams due to these issues.

        To address this, local authorities have initiated anti-encroachment drives aimed at reclaiming public spaces and clearing illegal structures. These efforts are intended to widen the roads and improve traffic flow, but the challenge remains significant due to the scale and persistence of encroachments.
